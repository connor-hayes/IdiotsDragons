  <h1>
    Welcome to the Homepage of Adventurers Anonymous
  </h1>

  <p>A land of mystery and danger awaits, and an unlikely group of adventurers is up to the task. They are warriors of the forest, and casters of powerful spells. Led by a man who can turn into a wolf, and haunted by a time travelling pyromaniac, these adventures will probably end up dead. Fighting goblins, trolls, elves, deep gnomes, each other, and even dwarves. <em>It's amazing that they aren't dead yet!</em>  </p>

  <h2>Our Heroes Somehow Stand United</h2>

  <p>Against threats that are occasionally hard to fight against. Unlike the roving bands of goblins, or the organized troll parties besieging the dwarves. Fire, explosions, and magic of all kinds put our heroes at the top of the food chain! What is next? Who will be the next victim-er, clients? That our heroes will help? Nobody but Nic knows because he is God or some crap like that.</p>
